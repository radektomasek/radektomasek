## Hi there üëã My name is Radek Tomasek, and I'm an experienced Software Developer.

### About Me ‚ú®

With over 10 years of experience as a **Software Engineer** specializing in **front-end** and **mobile development**, I bring a strong track record in building **scalable, high-performance applications**. Although my expertise leans toward **front-end development**, I have solid **full-stack** experience, with **TypeScript** and mainstream frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and **Angular** on the front end, alongside **Node.js** and **Golang** on the backend. I also work with **Dart/Flutter** and **React Native** for cross-platform mobile apps.

Passionate about creating **user-centric UIs**, enhancing **development practices**, and fostering **collaboration**, I've successfully scaled and optimized applications in **cloud environments** like **AWS**. Additionally, I am a committed **community builder**, having led a **front-end community of practice** for nearly three years to drive **best practices**, **knowledge sharing**, and **cross-team collaboration**.

### Recent Projects üìö

- **[OVO Charge Anytime](https://www.ovoenergy.com/electric-cars/charge-anytime) üîãüöó** - Played a pivotal role in developing and scaling this EV charging app from a handful of users to over 20,000. My responsibilities included implementing features to enhance user experience (such as simplifying the login process) and optimizing charging capabilities for various EV models. Built in Dart/Flutter, the app became a customer favorite and [won a National Technology Award in two categories: Innovation of the Year and Smart Tech Project of the Year](https://nationaltechnologyawards.co.uk/winners24.php) in the United Kingdom.

- **[Kanban Task Management](https://github.com/radektomasek/fm-kanban-task-management) üöß** - In my free time, I enjoy building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), ranging from basic HTML/CSS tasks to more complex projects. This Kanban Task Management app is one of their most [challenging projects](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB). While it‚Äôs still a work in progress, I am actively implementing advanced frontend patterns to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture.

### Leadership üåü

- **Kaluza/OVO Frontend Community of Practice:** For nearly three years, I led and nurtured a thriving community of practice focused on frontend development. While frontend topics were our main focus, we also covered a broad range of subjects through practical workshops and collaborative discussions. Some examples of my contribution can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oRaqAO3B7y5vyuimf3T_bcfkTDYjRVMB?usp=sharing).

- **Hackathons:** I have participated in multiple hackathons, often taking the initiative to build and lead teams. In several instances, we achieved first place by fostering collaboration, efficient workflows, and innovation under tight deadlines.

### Professional Goals üöÄ

- **Career Development:** I aim to deepen my expertise in backend development, focusing on building robust, scalable services and working with distributed systems. By strengthening my backend skills, I look forward to taking on more complex, end-to-end project ownership and contributing to architecture-level decisions.

- **Continuous Learning:** I‚Äôm committed to expanding my knowledge of cloud platforms, with a particular focus on gaining in-depth experience with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and exploring **Microsoft Azure**. My goal is to build a versatile skill set in multi-cloud solutions, enabling me to leverage the best tools and practices across different environments.
